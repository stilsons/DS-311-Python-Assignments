    "## 1. Green and Blue Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rows and Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything that you build in Tableau depends on whether we're using a green continuous field, or a blue discrete field. The first thing to understand is how we actually build a visualization, that is using drag and drop. So what we do is we drag and drop a continuous, or a discrete field onto our rows and columns and that will build the visualization. The combination of discrete continuous field determine the type of visualization that we get, whether it's a bar chart, a line chart, a pie chart, but to understand that we need to see the difference between using discrete and continuous field and Tableau has two very strict rules for this. The first rule, is for every continuous field that we put on a row or a column, we get an axis. Two important rule to remembers here,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Any green / continuous field add on the row or column will turns into an axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Any blue / discreet field add on the row or column will turns into header.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: \n",
    "- Drag sales out of the meausres and put it onto the column\n",
    "- We get the sum of sales return in a single bar\n",
    "- Drag profit onto column as well\n",
    "- We have one for sum of sales and one for sum of profit\n",
    "- Drag category field onto the rows\n",
    "- We get a category header, which includes furniture, office, supplies, and technology\n",
    "- We get three bars for each one of the two axes\n",
    "\n",
    "![rows and columns](images/green_blue_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Colors\n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets introduce a little bit of color in Tableau. The way that Tableau handles color depends on whether we're coloring by a green or a blue field, that is a discrete or a continuous field.  So it's really important to only use color where it actually helps your analysis rather than hinder it. Tableau has a maximum with 20 distinct colors it can show in any one particular time. If you've got 21, it will cycle round and start reusing some of the colors. So that can be really bad if you're trying to use that as some kind of color key. So I'd always recommend keeping it around five or six. Any more than that, is color a viable thing to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Drag profit field to column\n",
    "- Drag category and subcategory fields to row\n",
    "- Drag category field from data pane into color\n",
    "\n",
    "![color](images/green_blue_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filters\n",
    "\n",
    "The way that filtering works in Tableau is that you give it a measure or a dimension and then include or exclude certain values to filter those values out. And then Tableau will display the results of that filter. So the way I always think of it, is the left-hand side is the data pane. This is where all our data is. On the right-hand side is our view, the actual visualization of the data that we have. And then we have the little filters card between the two. So it's as if the data comes from over here on the left, is filtered through here in the middle, and that appears in our view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Drag profit field to column\n",
    "- Drag category and subcategory fields to row\n",
    "- Drag Category field from data pane into filter card\n",
    "- Check off the category within the field to exclude them\n",
    "- OR right click on the category field in the data pane and choose \"Show Filter\", then choose the cateogry to be included in the visualization\n",

    "## 2. Comparing Measures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measure names and measure values\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the real fundamental things to understand in Tableau is the difference between discrete and continuous fields. In Tableau, discrete fields are blue, continuous are green. In terms of the green and blue fields, the one we're interested in that moment in particular is what happens when we put them on the row and the column. Tableau has a very strict rule, and that is: \n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you put a green field, such as sales, onto the row or column, you get an axis. And the rule is, for every field that is green, you get one axis. So if I added in a second field, I get two axes. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what about if we want to do something different? Like, combine these fields into a single axis. Can we do that? Well, not by these rules, because every green field gives us an axis. However, Tableau has got a little trick up its sleeve to let you break its own self-imposed rules. That is where measure names and measure values come from. \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, what are **measure names** and **measure values**, and where are they in the data? If you look at the data pane, we have our dimensions and we have our measures. Some are discrete and some continuous. But you'll notice, there's also some fields that are in italics, such as *measure names*, *latitude*, *longitude*, *orders*, and the *measure values*. They're in italics because these are fields that Tableau has generated itself, they're not part of the underlying data. Tableau generates these fields so that we can use them as and when we need to. \n",
    "\n",
    "One particular case is when we want to combine more than one measure into a view. Remember, when I drag sales and profit onto the column, it gave us two axes. Well, what happens if we drag measure values? We get a single bar, we get a single axis called value. But something else has happened. We've got a new card called measure values, and within it is each one of our measures. The measure values actually acts as a container, so that's what happens if we put measure values on the column. \n",
    "\n",
    "What about if we put measure names on the row, what's going to happen? Well, in the typical behavior that Tableau does, whenever we put a discrete field, it breaks all of the marks into their lower components. So in this case, putting the measure names on actually breaks that measure value bar into a separate bar for each one of our measures. This means that we can actually have more than one bar existing on the same axis. Have we broken any of Tableau's rules? No, because we still have a single green field on the column, and one single axis. But, what Tableau has done is by using the measures and measure values as a container, it's actually letting us visualize the container and then smash the container into its component parts. So not only is Tableau satisfied the rules, but it allowed us to draw the visualization that we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to remove some of these measure values, we can do it. In our visualization, discount is actually a percentage, and it makes no sense to sum it up. In addition, percentage and the value is much smaller than anything like the sales or the shipping costs. so it actually is insignificant. To remove it, we simply highlight it and drag it out of the container. Now, in this particular view, it doesn't really make sense because the units are all different. But the fundamental concept of being able to compare individual measures is very, very useful. Measure names and measure values will sometimes appear when you least expect them, but they're nothing to be afraid of. All they are is a container to allow us to bypass Tableau's own internal rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a combined axis chart\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the really useful ways of comparing measures is to create a **Combined Axis Chart**. We can make use of the measure names and measure values containers. To create a Combined Axis Chart is actually very simple. It's all to do with where you drag and drop your field. To create a basic chart, we have to know where to drag and where to drop our fields to. When we start off Tableau, it helps us out by identifying, we could drop some fields in the center of the view, at the top, on the column, or on the rows. So let's go ahead and build a simple chart and then we'll go ahead and create a Combined Axis Chart. Let's try and compare the sales and profit. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drag and drop sales onto columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Drag and drop sub-category onto rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Drag and drop market onto columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "![combined axis chart](images/combined_axis_chart_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So what we have is a bar for each combination of market and sub-category, but now I want to see how well does sales compare against the profit. If I was to bring out a second value, say profit, and put that on column, what I now get is too many bars. For each combination of market and sub-category, I get my sales bar and I get my profit and it actually makes it hard to compare one against the other. What I want to do is align them so I can see the relative size of profit against sales, which is a lot easier to do when they're side by side. So to do that, I want to combine the axes together. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Drag and drop profit on the axis in the view.\n",
    "\n",
    "![combined axis chart](images/combined_axis_chart_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It changes profit from being the field name to showing the double axis icon. The view looks completely different. Instead of having the bars side by side, they now stack them one on top of another, but what's even more impressive is that we've actually got a whole new panel. We've got this measure names card with the profit and the sales. We've got the measure names in the filters and we've got measure names and measure values on the row and column. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what's happened? Well, Tableau's got this rule that says for every green field, you have an axis, but to get round that what is done instead is say, okay, I know what you want to do, so I'm going to let you bypass my rule by using the container measure values. Measure values can then be broken down using the measure names to give us the profit and the sales. So now for each combination of region, I now have the summer sales and the summer profit lined up against each other. So I can compare the sales for bookcases against the profit for bookcases and see how well they compare. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to be careful of is when you use the measure names and measure values that if you start moving some of the fields around, things can happen unexpectedly. Now that might be what you want, but it's always good to bear that in mind. For example, what happens if I drag measure names off of the rows and put it onto color. Well, we can see that we've got a stacked bar chart. We have the sales plus the profit. Now in this context, it doesn't really make sense because the profit is a component of the sales, you wouldn't necessarily add the two together. But if you had two values, maybe 2020 sales and 2021 sales, but you wanted to combine them together to get the total sales, then that might be a good choice. Measure names and measure values are simply containers that let us get round Tableau's own rules. One useful application is the Combined Axis Chart where it allows us to put one or more values onto a single axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a dual axis chart\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the common things that we have to do is compare measures. Now we've seen how we can combine two measures onto a single axis. And that works fine if the values that we're comparing on the axis are of a similar magnitude and also conceptually, the same sort of thing. But what if we're trying to visualize something where that's not true, what can we do then? Well, Tabluea has got another neat trick where we can create a **dual axis chart**. Remember, Tabluea has this in-built rule that says for every green field, you have to have an axis. But what we can do is to create what's called a dual axis chart. That is two fields, it gives two axes, but the axes are linked together to create the combined chart. So let's see this in action. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, I'm going to build a chart to show sales over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drag and drop sales onto rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Drag and drop order date onto columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Change the date to continuous month. \n",
    "\n",
    "![dual axis chart](images/dual_axis_chart_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I want to know if profit tracks sales. So as the amount of sales go up, do the amount of profits go up? Or maybe I'm interested in the discount. As we give a larger discount, does that also equate to sales going up or not? Well, if we were to just create the combined axis chart by dragging and dropping profit onto the existing axis, we can see the combined axis chart. \n",
    "\n",
    "![dual axis chart](images/dual_axis_chart_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to compare the actual amount we made in sales and actually amount we made in profit each month, this is a decent chart type to use because we're actually comparing lite with lite. The problem is we'd lose all of the detail in the profit. Are our profits increasing? Are they matching the sales? As sales go up and down, do the profits, go up and down? We lose all the definition because the orders of magnitude are different between the sales and the profit. And Tableau suppressed the second axis because we used them in that combined one. The problem is even worse, if we were to look at something like the discount. The discount is an average percentage and we can see it's basically a flat line. So again, we cannot say anything about the relationship between the sales and the discount because we simply can't see it. So lets get around this by creating a dual axis, where we can have both of our axes fully expanded, so we can see all the detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's try it with the discount. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Drag and drop discount all the way to the right-hand side in the view. When the second axis indicator appears, I can then release the mouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "![dual axis chart](images/dual_axis_chart_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "What we've got now is that combined dual access chart. We've got two fields and two axes. Interestingly for this particular example, We have one showing the sales in a currency and the other showing a discount in a percentage. What Tableau has done is that it's independently scaled the axes. So that we can actually see a greater amount of detail. So do the amount of discount and the amount of sales track? Well, it's a bit hard to see still. Okay, maybe we should try the profit instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Drag discount off.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Drag and drop profit onto the right-hand side and create the dual axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "![dual axis chart](images/dual_axis_chart_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, now we can see that it looks like a definite pattern. And the profit and sales pretty much track each other. We can see there's some interesting insights in here. For example, in November 2012, we can see that the sales increased by quite a lot, but the increase in profit was a lot lower. So you can see other examples where there was a widening and the pattern of the grossest sales and profit are the same. Now we couldn't say that in the combined axis, this is because both axes have been scaled to make maximum use of the space. If we want to actually check the values against each other, then we can synchronize both the axes together. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Right click on one of the axes, then click on synchronize and have both the axes scaled to the same amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "![dual axis chart](images/dual_axis_chart_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So dual access allows us to fit between synchronized and non synchronized axes. So whether the shape of the data or the value of the data is more important. One of the other advantage of the dual axis is that we can completely control both sets of marks because we have two marks cards. We have one for the sales and one for the profit. And if I wanted to change the sales color, I could do that independently of the profit, or even change the mark type to be a bar. Because we have two fields, we have two months cards, and we have two axes. This means that we have complete control over our visualizations. We can control the scaling. We can control the type of mark that has been displayed for each of our measures. So this is the true power of the dual axis chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Createing a bar in bar chart\n",
    "\n",
    "A great way to compare measures is using a bar in bar chart. This is particularly good if you're comparing something like sales to a sales target, because you can very easily see whether you reached or exceeded the target and how far away you are from doing so. To do that, we will need to bring in some extra information. But we are going to bring in some sales targets and use the measure names and measure values in order to visualize it. So let's go ahead and bring in our extra data. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Right click on data source and add a data connection. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Add a text file in the data folder, then choose the Sales Target.csv. \n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to bring that in and we'll define a relationship between the orders and the sales target, and that is going to be the subcategory for my orders its the same as the category name in the CSV file. So we've defined our relationship and we're good to go. \n",
    "\n",
    "![bar-in-bar](images/bar_in_bar_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing I'm going to do is build my bar chart, showing the sales per sub category. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Put the sales out on the columns and drag subcategory on the rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I can see all of my sales for each one of my particular categories. Next thing to do is bring in the sales target, which exists down in the lower part of the data connection, because we've got this connection now. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add sales target to the column.\n",
    "\n",
    "![bar-in-bar](images/bar_in_bar_2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "I can see the sales targets and sales, but it's hard to do that comparison. So what I need to do is combine the two together \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Drag sales target and drop it onto the existing access. \n",
    "\n",
    "![bar-in-bar](images/bar_in_bar_3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is going to create a combined access chart. What we can see here is that the measure values have magically appeared. And for each subcategory is now broken down into sales and sales target. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now this works quite well that the combined axis we can compare the sales and the sales target, but it's a bit busy. There's lots of bars in there. And actually it looks a little bit cluttered. So what we want to do is overlay the sales target on top of the sales. That way we can easily see whether we've reached or exceeded the sales target, and it makes for a much more compressed and concise view. So the next step is to actually take measure names off of the rows and put it into color. Now, what that's going to do is it's going to remove the sales and sales target headers. Instead we're going to have a single bar that's colored. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Take the measure names from rows and drop it onto the color.\n",
    "\n",
    "![bar-in-bar](images/bar_in_bar_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I've got the two values, one on top of the other. This is not a bar in bar chart. This is actually a stacked bar chart because if you click on one of the marks, you can see, we have our sales target in orange and my sales target in blue and notice, the left-hand side of the bar is at about a hundred thousand because it's stacked on top of the sales target. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now in the context of this, where we're comparing one against the other, stacking them together makes no sense, conceptually, it's just not the right thing. What actually want is for both of these bars to start at zero. At the moment, the sales one doesn't and to achieve that we have to tell Tablaeu not to stack bars on top of one another, but to always start it at zero. And that is under the analysis section at the very top of the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Click on the analysis top menu and select **stacked marks** and we're going to turn it off (which by default they're on).\n",
    "\n",
    "![bar-in-bar](images/bar_in_bar_5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can see that the bars are both starting at zero. I've got my blue bar and I've got my orange bar. So I can compare one against the other, but there's a problem. The sales is in blue and the sales target is in orange. So if the sales have exceeded the orange, we don't see it. What we want to do is actually change it so that the sizes are different so we can see one on top of the other. To do that, there's a little trick we can use with the measure names. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Drag measure names out of the data pane again, which is down at the bottom left-hand corner and drop it onto size.\n",
    "\n",
    "![bar-in-bar](images/bar_in_bar_6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can see that the sales is one size and the sales target is another. So we can see both at the same time. If I want to change the sales size, because it is a little bit on the small side, I can click on size and we can change the width of all of the bars, or if I want to change one specific one, if I go to the measure names card on the right-hand side and click edit, edit sizes, I can change the relative sizing of the bars to get the size that I like. Now we can see all of the sales have exceeded the target such as bookcases, where the blue bar is longer. And for those where we're way off target such as fasteners.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a multiple measure crosstab\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of comparing measures is to actually use a crosstab. Now it doesn't always feel like a crosstab is actually data visualization. But when you think about it, it is. It's data and it's being displayed in visual form. Just because it doesn't look like a bar or a line chart doesn't mean it's not a good visualization. And in the right place and in the right time and for the right circumstances, a crosstab can actually be a really good choice, particularly if we're after the specific values and we want to see them easily. So how do we build a crosstab? Well, actually it's pretty straightforward when we understand how Tableau builds its charts. And when you look at the screen when we first open Tableau, connect to some data, you see that Tableau has got three drop field here labels, one for the column, one for the rows. And we've mostly been using those through this course, but there's a third place where we can drop something, right in the center of our view. Drop field here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, whenever we build a visualization, we've always been using this concept of we are aggregating a measure and then we're splitting it by dimension. And that's exactly the same thing with a crosstab, because in the case of a bar chart, the marks that we split up are bars. In a line chart, the mark types are lines. Well, in a crosstab, the mark types are text. So what we're in fact doing is we are splitting the text into smaller and smaller numbers. Let's have a look at that in action to fully understand it. \n",
    "\n",
    "So say we want to look at our sales. The first thing we do is we drag sales into our view. Now I'm not going to put it on the rows of the column. I'm going to just drop it right in the middle. And we get the mark of a mark type of text. And it works exactly the same way that the bars and the lines do, that if I add dimensions to the rows and the columns, it's going to subdivide this up. So if I put, say, subcategory on the rows, it's now divided all of the marks up by sub category. And the mark type is text, so it gives me the numeric value. If I then want it to subdivide this further, say by segment, I could put that on the column. And now I can see the individual values for the corporate chairs, for example. So I can read along, read down and see what I want. Now that's just looking at a single measure, it's looking at the sales. So how do we bring in another measure? Say if I wanted to see sales and profit at the same time? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, if you think about when we did combined access charts, where we dragged and dropped the second field onto the access, it's kind of a similar principle. Now we didn't drag and drop sales onto our axis, we dropped it in the middle. So if we want to add in another measure, we have to drop it into the field again. So let's see what happens. I'll take profit and drag that and drop it in the center like we did before with the sales. Now measure names and measure values has magically appeared. Now we can see that actually we now have the sales and the profit one on top of the other. The reason for that is because we have profit and sales inside the measure values container, and the mark label that we're using is actually measure values. So if I put another measure value in here, we can expect to see it within the view. So if I was to add discount into the container, I can now see the sum of discount. Now, in our case, sum of discount doesn't make any sense. So if I change it average it now tells us the average discount for the consumer accessories is 13%, which has given us a profit of 60,000, with sales of 382,000. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we can create crosstabs in exactly the same way as we create bar charts, because we subdivide down the values. But the advantage with the crosstab over other types of visualization is that you can actually see the numbers underneath. Is this the correct chart type to use? Well, like most things in Tableau, it depends, but this is another good way of comparing measures. We can see both of the numbers and we can see all of the detail. Now, do we need to see all the detail or do we just want a rough idea that one is bigger than the other? If you want all the detail, crosstabs, a good choice, but it's hard to see how much bigger one value is than the other. So if we want to look at the different scales and the magnitude, then maybe the combined bar or a bar in bar chart is a better use. But you need to know which chart to use in which situation. And in a certain situation, crosstabs can do a great job.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating highlight table\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it's often derided as a bad way of showing data a cross tab can actually be very good under specific circumstances. And that is when you know where the data is you're looking for. Now what do I mean by that? Well, in this simple cross tab, we're looking at subcategory; a market. I'm looking at the sales for each combination. Now there's quite a lot of information in this view. There's 119 individual marks which corresponds to all the combinations of market and sub category. So there's a lot of information there. It's quite dense. It's quite hard to see anything. But what is good for is looking for a specific value. So if I wanted to know how many sales came from labels in Canada, that's actually quite easy to find because I simply look down the subcategory until I find labels, then go across till I find the column for Canada. And then I can see that Canada had 421 pounds worth. So if you know where you're looking for, the cross tab is actually quite efficient because they're looking at the coordinate. We know how many columns to go down, how many rows to go across. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now it gets to a point where the table could be very wide or very tall, but this principle would still apply. It would just take you slightly longer. Now the problem comes when we don't know what we're looking for. If I was just looking for the highest value being shown here. So that is which market and sub category gives us the highest amount of sales. That's actually quite hard to do because we're being asked to remember a lot of values. We're going to start possibly at the top left and scan down and across looking for a value that's higher than the one we're currently on. And that takes a lot of effort to do that. So a way that we can focus, people is to use color and turn this from being a cross tab into a highlight table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yhe first step is to just apply some color. Now the simplest way to do it is to color the text. So what I can do is I can take sales and drop that onto the color mark in the marks table. Now each of the values is colored depending on the value of the sales, the light of the blue, the lower sales, the darker, the blue, the higher sales. And then we can start to see some definition in those values. Some of the values look higher, some of them look lower, so we have to scan less of the table to find our answer. But actually it's still quite hard to do because there's still a lot of numbers there. So we can actually make it a little bit better. To turn it into a highlight table, what we're going to do is color the background of each one of the cells. To do that It's simply a case of changing the mark type that's being displayed For the moment the mark type is text. So that's why we see the numbers. If I change the mark type to be a square or Tableau I would do, will be to color each of the cells corresponding to the amount of sales and then label it with the value. So let's go ahead and do that. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the automatic mark type dropdown, I can select square. And now it's a lot clearer to see what's going on. Now, if I ask what is the highest value we've actually got much less data to scan through. We can easily see the darker colors so we can see that APAC Jen looks to have some darker ones. And there are these four cells here that are particularly dark, that it means I've just got to compare four values, one to the other, and that's a lot easier to do than 19. So a highlight table is a very minor modification to a cross tab, but it can have huge benefits. We still have the advantage of being able to find any value by scrolling across and down and looking at the values. So I can find a particular market and a particular sub-category can instantly find its answer. But also using the color I can scan look for the highest or the lowest, or look for any kind of detail within those numbers. So a highlight table gives us the best of both worlds and is a good gateway into removing the labels altogether.\n",

    "### Comparing two measures using a scatter plot\n",
    "\n",
    "A really useful visualization to compare quite a few measures in one very compact view is a scatterplot. Now scatterplots work by plotting the values of two measures on an X and Y coordinate. And then, once you've plotted the initial points, you can then add a load of extra information within those points. So let's take a look at how we build a scatterplot, and then how to turn it into a bubble chart and overlay loads of extra information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now a scatterplot uses one of the key principles in Tableau. That is, for every continuous field you put on a column or row, you get an axis. And one of the key properties of a scatterplot is it has two axis, X and Y. So that tells us that to build one in Tableau, we need two measures, that are continuous, need one on the column and one on the right. So with my dataset, we'll have a look and see how sales and profit compare. So let's put our sales on one axis and we'll put our profit on the other. Okay, now this doesn't look like a scatterplot, but it is. Because you have to remember what Tableau will always do. Tableau will always try and aggregate the measures together. And what we're plotting here is actually the sum of profit and the sum of sales. And the total sum of profit and the total of sum of sales is one single mark. So that's why we've just got the single mark. But what we really want to see is how this mark can be subdivided up, using some of our dimensions. It's much in the same way that we have to break open a bar chart into its components. Same thing's true with a scatter plot. So what about if we want to compare, say, a subcategory. Well, to do that, we make use of the detail card on the marks card. So if I drag subcategory, and put it onto detail, now, Tableau is calculating the sum of profit and the sum of sale broken down by sub-category. That gives us a point for each one. And we can keep doing this, and break them down more and more, or we could add some of the dimensions on the column. \n",
    "\n",
    "If I was to put category onto color. And to make it a bit clearer, I'm going to click on the mark type. I'm going to change it to a circle. Now we can see each circle represents one sub-category, colored by its parent category. Now, the more dimensions you add to the detail, the more it effects the view. And Tableau will always produce the view at the lowest level of detail. In this case, it's sub-category. So I have as many data points in the view as there are fields in sub-category. So if I add, say, the product name, which is the next level down in the category/sub-category hierarchy, as it were, I'm going to get a single point for every single category in our data set. So then we can see which ones of our products have high sales. These are going to be the products in the top half of our view. And which ones are profitable, well, they're going to be anything to the right-hand side. The dotted line here is zero. So anything to the right of it is going to be profitable. Anything on the left is going to be a loss. So we can see high profit, high sales, low profit, low sales, and we can do some deeper analysis of that. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we've added extra information through the color. We can also do it for size as well. Because at the moment, each of our data points, it's position is determined by the sum of profit and the sum of sales. But what about, say, the quantity? How many of these products do we sell? Well, we can't use position for that. And we're using color to determine whether it's furniture, office parts, or technology where we could use size. So if we drop our quantity on to size, and if I change the overall size of it, everything, we can see that some of the marks are bigger than others. Make it a bit clearer. I'm going to click on color. And I am going to add a border around my marks so they stand out a bit better. So now we can see this data point here is relatively large. So that means it's a higher number of sales. Size is not a great way to accurately compare values, but it gives us a good indicator. Because we can clearly see that some are bigger than others. For example, a particular item in the plot could have made a good number of sales, but made the least profit verus a high profit product could have sold a small number of them. So it might be that that's the product that we want to target. Maybe you want ask more questions about, well, who is buying it? What kind of discount we're giving? But clearly, we want to be selling more of these. Scatter plots are a fantastic tool because it allows us to condense so much information into a relatively small space. Here we are comparing profit, sales, quantity, split down by category, sub-category, and product name, but in a very compressed, easy to understand view, which makes them a fantastic way to compare measures."

    "## 3. Mapping the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Maps are one of the data types that people just love to make, and there's good reason for that. They're very visual. They're very fun. They can show a lot of data. And it's incredibly tempting that anytime you have any kind of geographic data that you can map, that people naturally create a map from it. But the first thing to think about when it comes to mapping and visualizing your data is is a map actually the best choice? My answer is we should only ever create a map where it actually enhances our understanding of the data. If we're just making it for the sake of it, that's not really a good use case. You should only create a map where the where is actually important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating an area map\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating maps in Tableau is incredibly straightforward. Now, if you have got a good reason to create a map, they can be an excellent way of showing data. They're very engaging and they can turn up a lot of information. The way that Tableau creates maps is dependent on the type of data that you have. If we look in the data pane, you see that you have all of the symbols, which tell you the kind of data type each one of the fields is. And several of them have got the little globe icon. Going into the data set, you can see that we have city, city state, country, and state, all have this little globe icon. What that denotes is that this is geographic data, or more importantly, this is what Tableau believes to be geographic data. When you first connect to your data source, if Tableau sees a column that is called city, state, country, it will assume that that is geographic data just based on the header name. If you have data where state means the status of something, pass, fail, truth, false, something like that. It will incorrectly assume that it's actually a geographic state. So in that case, you'll need to change the data type to be a string. \n",
    " \n",
    "How do you go and create a map in Tableau? Well, actually it's as easy as a double click or drag the geographic data to the view. So for example, we've got country in here, which is the highest level of geographic category that Tableau has in its hierarchy. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drag country into the very center of our view. \n",
    "\n",
    "An instant map. Now this is an example of a **symbol map**, but we want to create an **area map**. So to do that, typically, we want to have each of our geographic locations colored in. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. From the mark type, we change it from automatic to be a map. \n",
    "\n",
    "And now we have a field map. All of the countries in our data source have now have been mapped to their geographic location and colored in. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have that, we can then overlay more information. Now, if this chart type looks familiar to you, it's because it is, it's actually just a scatter graph. If you look on the rows and columns, you'll see we have two continuous measures. The rule for every continuous measure on a column or row you can access. So in actual fact, what this is, is a scatter chart, but the marks are actually the shape of the countries. Matched up with the scatter chart, we can then add extra color to our visualization, or use sizing or any of the other attributes. For example, if I want to color each of these countries by a dimension, region.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Drag region onto color, now each of my individual countries is colored by the region that they're in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of that, we might want to color it by a measure. Now in exactly the same way as with all the other mark types. When we put a continuous measure, we're going to get a color scale. If I put sales onto color, we can now see which countries have the higher or smaller sales, indicated here by the intensity of the blue. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of sales, we could maybe do profit, so I can see which countries are profitable and which ones we make a loss on. The top level is set at country, but in our data set, we have then state below the country. If I add state onto the level of detail, what that does is break the countries down into their smallest states. And we can see there's a lot more information being put in here. Now we're plotting over a thousand individual states. We can carry on subdividing this down by adding, city. But what city would do, would actually change it into a symbol map. We're just interested in, at the moment, at an area map.  If I take the state back off, and we go back up to country level, you'll see that at this level, most of the countries are visible. When I put the state back on, a lot of them, in Europe, in Africa, South America, are now empty. The reason for that is, is that we don't have data for those particular states. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, Tableau can only visualize what's in the database. So field maps are a good way of having a very broad picture, but again, one of the disadvantages is knowing what those countries actually are. You might have to have a second visualization to enable people to see a bit more detail in there. And for that, we might want a symbol map, which we'll talk about in another video.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a symbol map\n",
    "\n",
    "One way that we can map geographic data is using a symbol map. Now, unlike a field map, a symbol map doesn't rely on a map in the actual geographic area. We don't have an outline that we fill in, instead we use individual symbols as the marks. This is useful because we can then overlay additional information on top of the job that doesn't rely on the geographic boundaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look and see how we build that and how we can add things like size and color, and how even we can use different mark types to show some information. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Drag and drop the geographic data it into our view.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've got country, so let's go ahead and map some countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Drag and drop that into the view and we get an instant symbol map. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now what you might notice about this is that it actually, it's just a scatter plot. Scatter plots work by having two continuous measures, one on the column, one on the row, and then you break each individual data point down using the level of detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we've got latitude and longitude on the columns and rows, and it's broken down by country, so that means we have a single point for each country in our data set. Now the location of that data point is pretty much in the center of all of our countries, and because this is just a scatter plot with the map kind of hidden behind it, what we can do is we can add additional measures, or dimensions, onto the marks to further enhance our visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing we might want to use is size, so what about if you wanted to size each of these data points by a particular value? Well let's see what happens\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Drag sales on to size\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can see all of our data points have now been sized relative to each other, and relative to the amount of sales. This does shore up one of the problems with mapping data in particularly using a symbol map. We have some countries where we have large sales, and some country we have very small sales. And what happens is that the relative sizing means that some of them are get really hard to see. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can change that by either change the overall sizing, which would change the minimum-maximum across all the values. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Go to the summer sales legend at the top right and click edit sizes. I can change the mark size so that there's a greater or smaller range between the biggest and the smallest, so we can play around with how it looks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now this is very much dependent on how much of a ranger is in your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The size is one attribute we can use, another one is color. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Add profit onto the color. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now each of our points is now sized by the sales, colored by the profit, so we've got two attributes being shown by each point. To make it a little bit clearer, we've got some overlaying countries here and some that are very small to see. If I go into the color map, I can do edit colors, or I can go down to border and I can click on black to put a black border around it, to make it slightly easier to see because with this data set where we have orange to blue. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we go through the zero values, it looks kind of gray and we lose that in our background. That is just using a single mark, but we could actually use a pie chart. To do that, I just need to change the mark type. If I get rid of my sales and my profit, we can see now I've just got quite a large circle for each one of our particular countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Change mark type from a circle and select a pie.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it's not showing anything at the moment because we need to sub divide it up into different segments, \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Drag category onto color\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now see we have a pie chart divided up into our three categories that we have. But at the moment, all of the pie charts look identical, and that's because we haven't got a measure. Pie charts need two things, it needs a category to divide the segments, and it also needs an angle to plot the actual relative size of each one of those segments, so let's use sales. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Put sales onto angle\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now see a collection of pie charts each one showing the amount of sales, broken down by furniture, office supplies, and technology, for each one of our countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "This may not be the best use of a symbol map, but it's certainly something you can analyze and evaluate. It's still relying on geographic knowledge, but one of the advantages is that we're not relying on the individual country shape and size to show the visualization. In this point, all country sizes are equal so all of the pie charts sizes are equal too. Symbol maps allow to overlay more data than a normal map, so they can be an excellent way of visualizing geographic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating locations from coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau is a great way of visualizing geographic data. If Tableau knows where your states, or cities, or countries are. It can do it automatically for you. But what if all you have, is the latitude and longitude. How do you go about mapping that? So in this example, we're going to look at different data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what I've got, is this Excel file called \"*LA Stores.xlsx*\", that has a list of some stores. And we have the latitude and longitude of each one of those stores. And I want to plot those on a map, and do some analysis on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, I'm going to load this Excel file into Tableau. I'm going to click on Connect data. Click on Excel, and load up my Excel sheet. You can see the names of the stores, and I have the destination latitude and longitude. And I also got an origin latitude, longitude, which we'll use later on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, at the moment, Tableau doesn't know these cities. Doesn't know that these are cities and these are locations. All we got is a latitude and longitude. I want plot those on a map, to see those locations. By default, we have to use the destination latitude, and destination longitude, in order to build our map. Now a map in Tableau is just a scatterplot. Scatter plots worked by having a continuous measure on the column and the row, and then we break it down by a number of dimensions. So in this case, we've got the destination latitude and destination longitude. They are continuous measures, because they're green fields. So I can put those on the columns and rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Put the latitude onto rows and longitude onto columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have a single mark in our map. That's because it is showing the location of the average of all of the destination latitudes and all of the destination longitude. We need to subdivide this single mark into one, for each one of our individual locations. So to do that, we have to use the only dimension that we have, which is store. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Put the store onto the detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, I got all the locations from my dataset. The next thing I want to do, is add a new destination. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Change the map type from the light map to the outdoor map\n",
    "\n",
    "I can see some names. And what I want to do is add a new destination, but I don't know what it's latitude and longitude is, because it's not part of my original dataset. Now I could go and look it up, but Tableau would do it for us. We can make use of the annotations and we can add it to any map to get the information about the underlying latitude and longitude. Suppose that the area I'm interested in, is Carpinteria. I want to add that as a new store location, but I haven't got the latitude and longitude for this particular area. So, we can do is this little trick. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Right-click on the area that I want to put little pin in, then I go down to annotate and select the point on the map. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the annotation is just going to be the destination latitude, the destination longitude, which in this case, is the 34.398 and the -119.524. That is the latitude, longitude, of that particular point. What I can then do, is add that into my data source. So if I go back into my Excel file and add in those two values, 398, and -119.524 and save it. We go back into Tableau. and remove this annotation. Then go back to the data pane and hit refresh. Tableau will now reload that file in, recognize that it's now found this new row of data, and plots the location of the new store. Now I could go ahead and do that for any location in a map, but it's a really handy way of adding new things into our data. This little trick is a great way of adding new information to a map. It allows us to see the map, and pick and choose extra information that we want to include in our dataset. We don't have to rely on a third party tool, which can be really handy. "
